PhpBase 0.2a (http://www.phpbase.org)

What is it?
PhpBase is a free PHP library useful for submitting you website
dynamic content to Google Base.

Features:
Common field validation according to http://google.com/base/tab_attributes.html
Default scheme definitions (actually only Housing)
FTP Client for submitting to Google Base


Usage:

You can start using this library by including in your source the file PhpBase.php.
require_once('phpbase/PhpBase.php');

$PhpBase =& new PhpBase('Housing');

Where Housing is the schema found at phpbase/schemes/Housing.php
$PhpBase->setDomain('example.com');

If a domain name is specified, it will be appended to the id attribute.
$my_properties = array(
'12-LKF' => 
'title'=>'Nice house on the beach', 
'description' => 'Nice house with views to bay, 
It has an enormous deck for up to 10 boats' ),
'14-LKF' => 
'title'=>'Apartment in San Francisco', 
'description' => 'Cute apartment for sublet in 
downtown San Francisco'),
//.........you need to add more properties here
);

if($PhpBase->addItems($my_properties)){
    if($PhpBase->send('username', 
    'password', 'filename')){
        echo "Data was submitted 
        successfully to Google Base";
    }else{
        echo "There was an error on 
        the FTP connection to Google Base";
    }
}else{
    echo "Ooops, there where some 
    problems when preparing the data feed. 
    These are the attributes 
    where we found the problems ";
    echo join($PhpBase->getAttributesWithProblems());
}

You can also add row by row like this
if(!$PhpBase->addItem($single_property_array)){
    echo "There was an error on ".
    $PhpBase->lastError();
}

and the send it normally data as on previous example using
$PhpBase->send('username', 
'password', 'filename');

OR

You can also send the data as a Rss2 feed by setting an array with options as 4th parameter
$PhpBase->send('username', 'password', 'filename.xml',
   array(
       'format'=>'Rss2',
       'title'=> 'My Rss2 channel title',
       'description'=> 'My Rss2 channel description',
       'link'=> 'My Rss2 channel link'
   )
);

In order to create you own schema have a look to schemes/Housing.php and to the attribute helpers in the attributes/ folder
